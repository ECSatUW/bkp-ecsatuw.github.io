        <h3>Problems: 7.2, 7.9, 7.13</h3>

        <h4>7.9</h4>
        <p>A porous carbon material acts as an ideally polarizable electrode and has a double-layer capacity of 30\(\mu\)F/cm\(^2\) and a surface area of 250 m\(^2\)/g. Estimate the electric capacity of a cubic centimeter of electrode packed with this material. The density of the pure solid carbon is 2.25 g/cm\(^3\), its molar mass is 12.00 g/mol, and the porosity (void volume fraction) of the porous material is estimated to be 0.7 as packed. What difference in applied potential is required to effect a change of surface charge density of 10\(\mu\)C/cm\(^2\)? If this change of surface charge density is accomplished by the adsorption of chloride ions, what surface area, expressed in nm\(^2\) , is available to each adsorbed chloride ion?

        <h4>7.13</h4>
        <p>The Mn0 2 in the cell of Problem 2.21 is estimated to have a surface area of 58
            m\(^2\)/g. If this material has a double-layer capacity of 50\(\mu\)F/cm\(^2\) and can
            be polarized (i.e., displaced in potential) by 100 mV, how many coulombs
            can be associated with double-layer charging? How does this compare with
            the coulombs that can be passed in the discharge reaction? (The molar mass of
            Mn0\(_2\) is 86.93 g/mol.)</p>
